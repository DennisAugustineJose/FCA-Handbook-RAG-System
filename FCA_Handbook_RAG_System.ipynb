        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The increasing complexity of financial regulations and compliance requirements necessitates advanced tools to support professionals and regular individuals in navigating vast regulatory documents efficiently. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the UK’s primary financial regulatory body, responsible for regulating financial firms to ensure market integrity, protect consumers, and promote competition within the financial services industry. The FCA Handbook is a comprehensive and evolving set of rules and guidelines issued by the FCA that govern the conduct and operations of firms and individuals in the UK financial sector. Given the Handbook’s volume, technical language, and frequent updates, manual retrieval and interpretation of relevant information is time-consuming, error-prone, and often impractical for professionals who need quick and reliable answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project develops a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically designed for the FCA Handbook, the key regulatory framework for UK financial services. The system leverages the complementary strengths of retrieval techniques and large language models (LLMs) to deliver accurate, context-aware answers to complex regulatory queries. By retrieving relevant document segments and conditioning an LLM on this focused context, the model overcomes challenges of scale, vocabulary, and ambiguity inherent in large regulatory corpora.\n",
        "\n",
        "Central to the approach is a hybrid retrieval pipeline that combines semantic search using dense embeddings with keyword-based matching, enhanced by query rewriting to clarify user intent. A neural reranker refines retrieval results, while a dynamic context builder manages input length constraints to maximise the quality of generated responses. This integrated pipeline offers a robust and adaptable solution for navigating and interpreting extensive financial regulations.\n",
        "This report details the design, implementation, and evaluation of the RAG system, establishing a reproducible framework for automated question answering on regulatory texts.\n"

        "## The Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "The foundation of this RAG system is a domain-specific dataset derived from the FCA Handbook, which serves as the primary regulatory framework governing financial compliance in the United Kingdom. While this implementation focuses on the UK context, the architecture is adaptable by substituting the FCA Handbook with equivalent regulatory documents from other jurisdictions. The model can support compliance analysis across different national or regional financial authorities this way.\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure access to the most up-to-date regulatory content, the FCA Handbook was dynamically retrieved using direct PDF URLs, rather than relying on a manually maintained local directory of downloaded documents. This approach eliminates the need for ongoing manual updates and version tracking, as the latest version is automatically fetched during execution. By accessing the source documents programmatically, the system avoids the risk of referencing outdated material, thereby enhancing reliability and relevance. While an official API would have been the ideal mechanism for structured and real-time access, the FCA does not currently offer such an interface. As a result, this method of direct retrieval represents a practical and effective alternative, enabling a pseudo-live dataset rather than a static one, helping maintain a single source of truth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the dataset does not explicitly include other documents such as acts passed by the UK Parliament or related legislative instruments, the FCA Handbook is shaped by and closely aligned with these statutory sources. The regulations, rules, and guidance issued by the FCA are developed in accordance with the legislative mandates set out in primary legislation. As a result, the system remains grounded in the broader legal context, ensuring that compliance guidance derived from the Handbook effectively reflects and enforces the intentions of the UK’s financial regulatory framework.\n"

        "## RAG Development and Enhancements\n",
        "\n",
        "The FCA RAG system is designed to enable precise, context-aware question answering over the FCA Handbook, which governs financial regulation in the UK. The first step involved preprocessing the raw data by converting the handbook’s PDF content into coherent, standalone chunks, typically at the paragraph or subsection level. These chunks were cleaned to remove duplicates, low-value content, and artefacts, and then enriched with metadata such as section titles and source URLs to enhance interpretability and traceability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each chunk was then encoded into dense vector embeddings using the BGE model, which were indexed via FAISS for efficient semantic retrieval. In parallel, a sparse retrieval pipeline using BM25 was implemented to ensure strong keyword-level matching, particularly important in the regulatory domain, where specific terminology carries legal weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "To improve the quality of incoming queries, a rewriting module powered by the OpenHermes model was introduced. OpenHermes, an instruction-tuned LLM built upon the Mistral-7B architecture, was used to rephrase vague or underspecified questions into richer, more targeted prompts. These rewritten queries were sent to both FAISS and BM25, and their outputs were merged and reranked using a neural scoring model. This reranking prioritised the most contextually relevant chunks, ensuring that the system selected the best supporting evidence for the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "The generation step involved dynamically building an input context using the top-ranked chunks, constrained within the model’s context window. This process balanced the need for broad informational coverage with the requirement for tightly focused relevance. The LLM then generated answers conditioned on this context and the user query, with controlled decoding settings to maintain factuality and coherence.\n",
        "\n",
        "This layered architecture combining hybrid retrieval, neural reranking, query rewriting, and controlled generation forms the backbone of FCA RAG, enabling accurate, traceable, and high-quality responses in a complex regulatory domain.\n"

        "## Testing and Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "BERTScore was used as the primary evaluation metric due to its ability to measure semantic similarity between generated and reference answers using contextual embeddings. The baseline LLM-only model achieved an average BERTScore F1 of 0.8181, with a precision of 0.7832 and a recall of 0.8567. In contrast, the enhanced FCA RAG pipeline, including query rewriting, hybrid retrieval, dynamic chunking and reranking, achieved a BERTScore F1 of 0.8043, with improved precision (0.7867) and slightly lower recall (0.8228). While there was a minor trade-off in F1, the improvement in precision indicates that the enhanced system generated more focused and relevant responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "These results highlight the effectiveness of the architectural enhancements. The query rewriting step helped interpret vague user inputs more effectively, while the hybrid retrieval pipeline broadened the scope of the search and ensured the inclusion of semantically and lexically relevant material. Reranking fine-tuned this output further, delivering high-quality chunks to the generation module.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system was evaluated on a diverse set of queries, encompassing straightforward, ambiguous, and domain-specific examples. These tests did not reveal any significant failure cases, demonstrating that FCA RAG performs reliably across different query types. Future work could involve broadening the range of queries, applying more domain-specific fine-tuning, experimenting with alternative retrieval methods, and exploring multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation to further enhance performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Limitations include a small evaluation dataset, which restricts statistical significance, and manual inspection of answers, which may introduce some subjectivity. To test the model, token size, batches and top-k retrieval were kept to a minimum, which may have constrained performance. Moreover, the LLM and reranker were used with minimal domain-specific fine-tuning, suggesting room for further improvement.\n"

        "## Future Improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "Several options remain for advancing FCA RAG from a robust prototype to a production-grade system. First, the evaluation dataset can be significantly expanded and diversified to include more complex and edge-case queries. This would enhance the reliability and statistical strength of benchmarking efforts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Incorporating a dedicated domain-specific reranker, fine-tuned on regulatory language, could further improve chunk selection and downstream answer quality. Likewise, fine-tuning the LLM itself on historical regulatory Q&A pairs or other financial legal corpora would allow for a more nuanced understanding of compliance-oriented queries.\n",
        "Real-time updates remain a challenge. Although FCA RAG dynamically retrieves the latest PDFs from the FCA website, structured access via an official API would greatly improve consistency and reliability. If such an API were to become available, integrating it would be a high-priority enhancement.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, developing a web-based interface would significantly enhance usability. This would enable professionals to interact with the system in a more accessible environment, paving the way for broader adoption. Long-term extensions may also include multilingual support and adaptation to other regulatory domains by substituting in the appropriate regional documents.\n",

        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates a functional and extensible Retrieval-Augmented Generation system customised for the FCA Handbook. By integrating dense and sparse (hybrid) retrieval with query rewriting, reranking, and dynamic chunking, FCA RAG provides precise, traceable, and contextually grounded responses to complex regulatory questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The evaluation shows that these enhancements produce semantically rich answers that perform well against a naive LLM-only baseline, especially in terms of relevance and clarity. While there is room for improvement through expanded datasets and fine-tuning, the current architecture already represents a substantial advance toward automating regulatory comprehension.\n",
        "\n",
        "FCA RAG lays a strong foundation for future research and deployment in legal and financial compliance domains, illustrating how advanced NLP techniques can streamline access to intricate regulatory texts and make it accessible to a broader audience."
