# Financial Conduct Authority Retrieval-Augmented Generation (FCA RAG)


The increasing complexity of financial regulations and compliance requirements necessitates advanced tools to support professionals and regular individuals in navigating vast regulatory documents efficiently. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the UK’s primary financial regulatory body, responsible for regulating financial firms to ensure market integrity, protect consumers, and promote competition within the financial services industry. The FCA Handbook is a comprehensive and evolving set of rules and guidelines issued by the FCA that govern the conduct and operations of firms and individuals in the UK financial sector. Given the Handbook’s volume, technical language, and frequent updates, manual retrieval and interpretation of relevant information is time-consuming, error-prone, and often impractical for professionals who need quick and reliable answers.

This project develops a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system specifically designed for the FCA Handbook, the key regulatory framework for UK financial services. The system leverages the complementary strengths of retrieval techniques and large language models (LLMs) to deliver accurate, context-aware answers to complex regulatory queries. By retrieving relevant document segments and conditioning an LLM on this focused context, the model overcomes challenges of scale, vocabulary, and ambiguity inherent in large regulatory corpora.

Central to the approach is a hybrid retrieval pipeline that combines semantic search using dense embeddings with keyword-based matching, enhanced by query rewriting to clarify user intent. A neural reranker refines retrieval results, while a dynamic context builder manages input length constraints to maximise the quality of generated responses. This integrated pipeline offers a robust and adaptable solution for navigating and interpreting extensive financial regulations. This report details the design, implementation, and evaluation of the RAG system, establishing a reproducible framework for automated question answering on regulatory texts.
